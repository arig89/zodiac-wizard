    "\t•\tThis interactive project takes user input and will return information about zodiac signs.\n",
    "\t•\tIt was created because I wanted a simple project to show my friends how cool coding in Python can be! \n",
    "    •\tMostly, it's just for fun, since astrology doesn't really have \"practical\" applications :)\n",
    "   \n",
    "    The wizard can do the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "\t⁃\tTells you what sign you are based on your birthday.\n",
    "\t⁃\tGives you a monthly horoscope based on your sign (optional).\n",
    "\t⁃\tCan test a friend's birthday with the wizard (if you don't care about your own horoscope).\n",
    "\t⁃\tCan test astrological compatibility between you and a friend (if you don't care about horoscopes at all).\n",
    "\t⁃\tCan be easily quit if you don't want to know anything other than your sign.\n",
